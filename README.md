# Periculum - A torrent search engine

## Disclaimer
### NOTE: This is just for educational purposes
  * Periculum is an aggregator and a Multisearch. This means we just search other search engines.
  * Periculum is a very powerful internet location search tool.
  * Periculum does not host or "make available" any files or torrents in any way, shape or form.
  * Periculum links to other independent search engines that might host torrent files. We have       absolutely no control over those domains.
  * Indexing process is completely automated. We don't check it. Whatever the Scraper finds, are sucked in. The good, the bad and the ugly.
  * Periculum files are simply metadata and cannot be copyrighted.
